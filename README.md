## Features & information

##### Main features:
```
* Merged linux-stable (upstream to Linux 3.18.140).
* Merged f2fs-stable (upstreamed F2FS).
* Merged latest compatible prima drivers (upstreamed Wi-Fi drivers).
* Optimized prima drivers (reduced debugging and unnecessary wakelocks).
* Clean, optimized, and minimal imports of code for rosy (based on riva-o-oss branch).
* Optimized touchscreen drivers (fixed freezing and reduced debugging).
* Reduced unnecessary debug and removed useless hard-coded debug.
* Can be compiled with GCC 9.2.1 & -O3, all code warnings are fixed.
* Compiler tuned for Cortex-A53 (CPU optimization).
* Memory optimizations.
* Full F2FS support.
* Miscellaneous config improvements that are not listed here.
```

## Cloning & building

For ROSY:

This kernel contains submodules. To build it successfully, you have to either clone it with `--recursive` option or do `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the kernel directory after cloning.

Make sure you are building the kernel with `rosy-perf_defconfig`. In case you want to base on another defconfig, you can easily enable ROSY's drivers in any config using the kernel's `menuconfig`. You can find a special section with drivers for ROSY in `menuconfig > Device Drivers > Drivers for ROSY`. Do not forget to build the Wi-Fi (prima) drivers though, they are located in `menuconfig > Device Drivers > Staging drivers`.

##### Steps (normal defconfig):
```
1 - make ARCH=arm64 <defconfig>
2 - make ARCH=arm64 menuconfig
3 - make ARCH=arm64 savedefconfig
4 - mv defconfig arch/arm64/configs/menuconfig_defconfig
```

##### Steps (raw defconfig):
```
1 - make ARCH=arm64 <defconfig>
2 - make ARCH=arm64 menuconfig
3 - mv .config arch/arm64/configs/menuconfig_rawconfig
```
